	I'm planning on a big update of visuals.
	The new design will be influenced by how we use our smart phones.

04/15/2024
	VERY busy week this week...
 	Gotta focus on school work, but will continue learning JS at least a little bit everyday.

04/08/2024
	I've decided that I'm not gonna focus on making my website visually appealing.
 	It'd be nice to have beautiful UI/UX, but It's very time consuming...
  	I think it'd be better for me to focus on making my ideas come true.

	I'm not sure how to practice the things that I'm learning in JS class.
	I might make a JS playground for me to practice.

04/02/2024
	Finished CSS class yesterday and started JS class today!!!

03/21/2024
	Wish I had more time to work on this :(
	Slow progress is far better than no progress.
	And I've been working hard on other stuff :D
03/09/2024
	I've been so busy with school work. I'm half way through the CSS course.
	I realized how messy it can get by having just one css file for multiple pages. So I divided them up again.

02/23/2024
	I've been adding some more CSS to this!
	I also added about_me page as a resume page hehe
	Not finished yettttt
	The school work has been quite busy, so I've only finished about a quarter of the CSS course.

02/23/2024
	I've finished HTML course, and I started CSS course!
	I'm going to plan out my website.
	The one thing that I'll be contantly scheming will be how I can make a good first impression.
	I want the core principle of my website to be "Simple". I want it to be well organized.

02/22/2024
	I've decided to just start from the ground up!
	Wish me luck!
	I also wanna utilize git branches more!
	
	I successfully deployed a simple HTML to the internet hehehe

	I just felt like making my own website.
	I have never used react before.
	It's gonna be fun :D
