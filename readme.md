	I also added about_me page as a resume page hehe
	Not finished yettttt
	The school work has been quite busy, so I've only finished about a quarter of the CSS course.

	I've finished HTML course, and I started CSS course!
	I'm going to plan out my website.
	The one thing that I'll be contantly scheming will be how I can make a good first impression.
	I want the core principle of my website to be "Simple". I want it to be well organized.

	I've decided to just start from the ground up!
	Wish me luck!
	I also wanna utilize git branches more!
	
	I successfully deployed a simple HTML to the internet hehehe
